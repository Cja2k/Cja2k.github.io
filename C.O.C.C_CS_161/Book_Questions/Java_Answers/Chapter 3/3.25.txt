When the object is created you assign a rollOverLimit int, this is then assigned to the private int limit. When the increment meathod is run it sets the value to equal [(value + 1) % limit]. The increment function is barely doing any work it's mainly the Modulus function. The modulus checks to see if the (value + 1) is equal to limit, if it is it sets value to 0, but if it's not equal to limit it simply goes up by one.
