When the amount in setValue is a string or negative, the setValue piece just ignores the line and keeps the current value. The amount over just resets it to 0. For a string you could print "Invalid Type, Only Numbers Allowed", for the negative you could either say an error message or have it tick down, and for the amount over you could print an error message, count to the amount and carry over whats left, just make it set to 0, or just not allow numbers higher than the amount left.
