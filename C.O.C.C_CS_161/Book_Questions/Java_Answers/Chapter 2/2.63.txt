Theres several ways to do this, one being we could have the print be in a huge if statement and have it check if a boolean is set to true for a discount, another way is adding a whole new meathod which is the way I plan to do this. One thing i had to change was a lot/all of the int's to double's to handle decimals.

 * reduce the current balance by the ticket price. Print

public void printTicket()
{
	double amountLeftToPay;
	amountLeftToPay = (balance - price) *-1;
	
	boolean amountLeftToPayACTUAL;
	amountLeftToPayACTUAL = false;
	
	double amountLeftToPayTEXT;
	amountLeftToPayTEXT = amountLeftToPay;

	else if (amountLeftToPay == 0) {
